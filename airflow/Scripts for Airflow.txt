On Linux, the quick-start needs to know your host user-id and needs to have group id set to 0.
Otherwise the files created in dags, logs and plugins will be created with root user. 
You have to make sure to configure them for the docker-compose:

mkdir -p ./dags ./logs ./plugins
echo -e "AIRFLOW_UID=$(id -u)" > .env

Import the official docker setup file from the latest Airflow version:

curl -LfO 'https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/docker-compose.yaml'

copied the dockerfile , docker-compose.yaml, requirements.txt and scripts folder files from below github link

https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/cohorts/2022/week_2_data_ingestion/airflow/1_setup_official.md


then run below command to build the image
docker-compose build

then run below command to initialize airflow
docker-compose up airflow-init

then run below command to initiate the backend services like scheduler, worker etc
docker-compose up

we can check the list of services that are up by using below command
docker-compose ps

once the webserver is ready , we can login the web gui and check
credentials can be obtained from line 244 and 245 of docker-compose.yaml

To clean up space occupied by docker builder cache
docker builder prune -a -f
